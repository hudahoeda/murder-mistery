## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or newer)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
-   A [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) instance (you can use a free cloud instance or run it locally via Docker).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/murder-mistery.git
    cd murder-mistery
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and update it with your Redis connection URL.
    ```sh
    cp env.example .env.local
    ```

    Your `.env.local` should look like this:
    ```env
    # Example for a local Redis instance
    REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üîß How to Customize Your Own Mystery

All game content is stored in the `lib/data` directory. You can create a new mystery by modifying the contents of these JSON files.

-   `puzzles.json`: Defines the puzzles, their order, their type (which maps to a React component in `components/puzzles/`), the clues they unlock, and their point values.
-   `clues.json`: Contains the text and metadata for all the clues that can be revealed.
-   `evidence.json`: A list of all evidence items, including images and descriptions.
-   `suspects.json`: Defines the characters in the story, including the culprit.

To create a new puzzle type, you would:
1.  Create a new React component in `components/puzzles/`.
2.  Add a new puzzle definition in `puzzles.json` and set its `type` to match the name of your new component.
